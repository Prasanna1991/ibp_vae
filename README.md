## Indian Buffet Process VAEs

This repository contains the code for the paper "Structured Variational Autoencoders for the Beta-Bernoulli Process", 
by Jeffrey Ling, Rachit Singh, and Finale Doshi-Velez. The paper is itself forthcoming on the ArXiv, but a workshop
version should be available soon at the [AABI NIPS workshop](http://approximateinference.org/accepted/).

This codebase is somewhat incomplete, missing some code that we haven't had time to clean up. We're working 
on putting all of the code up as soon as possible, and will do so over the next few weeks. Please let us know 
if you run into problems by making an issue.
